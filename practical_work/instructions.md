# Project Description: Fire Detection

This project focuses on fire detection using a provided dataset. The dataset contains three folders: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. However, there are specific constraints and guidelines to follow.

## 1. Dataset Access and Restrictions
Please download the dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset/code

The dataset is composed of a training set, a validation set, and a test set. You are not allowed to access the label of the training set. 

Important: Any use of annotations from the training set will result in a zero grade.

## 2. Dataset Splitting
Split the original validation set into a new validation set and a new train set. You can use the original training set creatively, but without utilizing its labels.

## 3. Model Training
Train your deep neural network (DNN) using the newly defined training and validation sets. Feel free to use any methodology or additional resources to improve your model's performance, as long as you respect the annotation constraints.

## 4. Evaluation and Submission
- Evaluate your model's performance on the new test set.
- Submit the following:
    - Code: Implemented in PyTorch.
    - Pretrained Model: Include the trained weights.
    - Report: A concise explanation of your approach, the methods used, and the reasoning behind your choices.

## 5 Collaboration Rules
Form groups of four students, ensuring diversity by including members from different schools. Groups composed entirely of students from ENSTA will not be accepted. I want to force the mixture of students.
